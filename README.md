Once you press enter you will find the menu screen:

To select the options you need to enter the number that appears next to each option, if choosing 1 this will take you to the index:

<img src="./resources/indexmenu.png">

Choose any of this option to get a list of movies base on the option selected(Ex. 2):

<img src="./resources/moviesindex.png">

Now on top you will see the number of movies on this list, also you can see the list by pages do you don't need to scroll to find a movie, and you can change pages using n(next) or b(back), also you can go back to menu by pressing m, then to see the movie profile you need to enter the number next to it(Ex. 19):

<img src="./resources/movieprofile.png">

Now you can see all the basic details of the movie including brief info about it. To go back just press enter.

When you select the search option on the menu, you first will have to wait a couple of seconds after the program gets all the movies from the page, then it will ask you to enter the name of the movie, like this:

<img src="./resources/searchscreen.png">

Enter a word(Ex. batman) and this will return all the movies that contain that word on their name:

<img src="./resources/searchresults.png">

Now you only have to enter the number of the movie you want to see the info off, just like we saw before if you want to look for another movie just press enter, and it will ask you again to enter a name, to go back to the menu just press m on the search by name screen.

The App also includes a bookmark option you can find on the movie profile, in case you want to compare movies one to another, you save as many as you can and then from the menu you select the option 5, and this will show you the list of bookmarked movies in list of 20 movies per page.

Once on the bookmark menu you can open each movie profile just like before and even remove the movie from the bookmarks.

To end there is also a history option on the menu, that let you see all the movies profile you have visited in case you forgot to bookmark a movie and dont want to search for the movie again, you can find it on the history.
