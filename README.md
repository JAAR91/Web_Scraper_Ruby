It's simple, once open you find yourself on the welcome page:

Once you press enter you will find the menu screen:

<img src="./resources/menu.png">

To select the options you need to enter the number that appears next to each option, if choosing 1 this will take you to the index:

<img src="./resources/indexmenu.png">

Choose any of this option to get a list of movies base on the option selected(Ex. 2):

<img src="./resources/moviesindex.png">

Now on top you will see the number of movies on this list, also you can see the list by pages do you don't need to scroll to find a movie, and you can change pages using n(next) or b(back), also you can go back to menu by pressing m, then to see the movie profile you need to enter the number next to it(Ex. 19):

<img src="./resources/movieprofile.png">

Now you can see all the basic details of the movie including brief info about it. To go back just press enter.

When you select the search option on the menu, you first will have to wait a couple of seconds after the program gets all the movies from the page, then it will ask you to enter the name of the movie, like this:

<img src="./resources/searchscreen.png">

Enter a word(Ex. batman) and this will return all the movies that contain that word on their name:

<img src="./resources/searchresults.png">

Now you only have to enter the number of the movie you want to see the info off, just like we saw before if you want to look for another movie just press enter, and it will ask you again to enter a name, to go back to the menu just press m on the search by name screen.
